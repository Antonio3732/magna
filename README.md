- *Some sites have compilicated structure so, adding them is kind of complicated and hard.*
- *Also, other sites have the same kind of setup, with just the name of the website as a difference.*

## Development
- Setup first with the Vercel CLI (install with `npm i -g vercel`)
```
vercel dev
```
*It will setup the app in the first run then, it will launch it after.*
- You can also first move the `main.py` to the outside or parent folder then run the app using `uvicorn`
```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Note:
**This service is just made for fun and personal use. It is not meant to be for commercial or business purposes.**
- This is meant to be hosted on a serverless platform (Vercel). You can modify it at your own if you want to host it on your own server.
